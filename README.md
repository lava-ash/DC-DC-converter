DC-DC Buck Converter – From Simulation to PCB

Overview:

This project documents my journey of designing a DC-DC Buck Converter — starting from the theory and simulations in LTspice, then moving through schematic capture and PCB design in KiCad, and finally addressing the practical considerations of part selection and manufacturability.

A buck converter (step-down converter) is one of the most widely used power electronic circuits. It efficiently reduces a higher DC voltage to a lower DC voltage using switching, energy storage elements (L and C), and a feedback loop for regulation.

Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this project, I explored and applied several fundamental concepts in power electronics and PCB design:

-> PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): Duty cycle control and its direct effect on output voltage.

-> Feedback Loops: How error amplifiers and comparators regulate voltage and maintain stability.

-> LC Filters: Reducing output ripple and ensuring smooth DC delivery.

-> MOSFET Switching: Acting as the main element to regulate energy transfer.

-> PCB Layout Practices: Trace width selection, current handling, component placement, and EMI minimization.

-> Parts Availability vs. Ideal Specs: Adapting the design to components that are feasible, affordable, and locally available.

Challenges faced:

-> Component footprints not always matching library defaults

-> Selecting inductors/capacitors that were actually available

-> Trace width calculations for current handling

-> Placement for performance and thermal stability

-> Learnings & Takeaways

-> Theory and simulation are important, but real-world constraints (parts availability, PCB design rules, thermal limits) are what make or break a design.

-> PWM + feedback loops are at the heart of nearly all modern power electronics.

-> PCB design is as much art as it is engineering — placement and routing choices directly affect stability and performance.

-> Documenting the process not only reinforces learning but also builds a portfolio for future projects.

Next Steps:

Test PCB after fabrication and characterize efficiency, ripple, and load response.

Explore microcontroller-based PWM generation for finer control.

Scale design to higher power levels and more complex topologies (boost, buck-boost).
